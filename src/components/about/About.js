            During a successful IT career in Technical and Systems Administrator roles, I attained extensive experience in desktop and server infrastructure design, building, support, and maintenance; which I find highly beneficial when developing software. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            As with my technical IT experience, I have a reasonably broad range of experience with software development technologies too. In 2010, I was fortunate to gain 14 months of full-time software development experience in a previous role, building various .Net Windows applications in C#, both standalone and utilising SQL. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Since then I completed some C# development projects, and I segued into web development and more recently into React development. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            I’m comfortable working with the React library, and developing in C#, JavaScript (including ES6), HTML, and CSS; as well as working with JSON, API’s, and Web tokens, among other things.
            <br></br><br></br>
            I am a highly motivated person with wonderful people skills, social confidence and great written and verbal communication skills. I naturally “think outside of the box", so I love being challenged by complex problems. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            I’m self-taught in all things IT, so I’m used to jumping into the deep end, and kicking like crazy until I get to the top and swim! 
            Additionally, I have gained a wealth of skills and experience as an entrepreneur, which apply well with software development; resilience, persistence, prioritising, and sales are a few worth mentioning.
