            During a successful IT career in Technical and Systems Administrator roles, I attained extensive experience in designing and building desktop and server infrastructure. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Along the way I learned software development; starting with building Windows apps with C# and .Net Framework and moving later into website development - Wordpress, HTML, CSS and JavaScript then on to working with ReactJS.
            <br></br><br></br>
            I have worked on various freelance development projects for businesses, ranging from static websites and CRM modifications, to more complex projects like a customer-logged fault tracking web portal.
            <br></br><br></br>
            My past technical experience puts me ahead of many developers, as I have in-depth knowledge and skills of many backend technologies, which is beneficial for providing stable and reliable front end applications.
